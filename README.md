# SimonGame

This web game is based on a real toy known as simon. You have to follow the pattern flashed by the website.

The website creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
